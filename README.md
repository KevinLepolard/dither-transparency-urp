## Overview

This project features an efficient dither tarnsparency shader which uses a world-space Bayer dither matrix to cull object pixels to 'fake' a transparency-like effect without the need to implement actual transparency. It uses the features of Shader Graph and Universal RP. An accompanying tutorial is available on [danielilett.com](https://danielilett.com/2020-04-19-tut5-5-urp-dither-transparency/).
